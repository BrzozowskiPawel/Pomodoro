# Pomodoro 🍅
Swift app that can help to stay focussed. In this project I have added UserDefaults to story setting for each Pomodoro. </br>
It uses a timer to break work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Each interval is known as a pomodoro, from the Italian word for 'tomato', after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer Cirillo used as a university student.
